# Controlsystem
This program is a dormitory central control system simulator that implements dormitory control facilities with object-oriented programming language C++ based on its motif. 
Printers, air conditioners and doors, a total of three systems existing in dormitories, will be centrally controlled and all equipment consist of an Internet of Things environment. 
An integrated control system is built as above-mentioned. 
You can actually put registers of devices in. In our submission work, the register is the address to the elements of the instance to be created, such as the ink/paper of the printer. 
In commercial service, we can get the address of the embedded because it is linked to the embedded, but we created a class and simulated it.
Data can be stored and recalled to back up/restore existing existing and addressed states.
The purpose of file input and output is to restore the file upon reboot after shutting down the server PC, such as power outage/electric construction.

# Register
The actual embedded program receives and processes values through the register. 
The Control System manages embedded devices with four registers each. Printed, air-conditioned, door-to-door.
The roles of each register are as follows table:

GPIO_CDM : store elements that are Power, Authority, Usage-Mode State. This register is set as follows table:
